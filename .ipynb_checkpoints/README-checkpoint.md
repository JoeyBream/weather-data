# Weather Data

## Overview
This project visualizes weather data in London over the past 10 years to assess changing requirements for chillers and boilers in the city.

## Files
- **graphs.ipynb**: A comprehensive report that covers the project's goals, providing visualizations of the weather data.
- **data.ipynb**: A detailed notebook that explains data creation and handling. It includes notes and demonstrates how to use pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for graph creation. This is particularly useful for beginners interested in learning these tools.

## Usage
1. **Viewing the Report**: Open `graphs.ipynb` to explore the visualizations and insights related to the changing requirements for chillers and boilers in London.
2. **Understanding Data Handling**: Open `data.ipynb` to see how the data was processed. This notebook serves as a beginner's guide to using pandas and Matplotlib.

I've copied an explainer on Jupyter notebooks below, but you should be able to just click on the Github files listed above and see the contents and graphs.

To run this on your own computer, in a way you can edit, I recommend downloading Anaconda. 

First, download this repository (collection of files) from Github by selecting 'Code' -> 'Download Zip'.

Then, download Anaconda and get it running. Once open, select 'Jupyter Lab' from the options. Then upload these project files and you should be good to go!

Any issues, reach out to me. This should be a beginner friendly project, so I would be happy to help if there are any barriers to entry.
